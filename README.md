# 🔹 What is SPECKit Plus?
Spec-Kit Plus is a framework that helps you build software in a smarter way. It doesn’t just create working code  it also helps you capture your thinking, decisions, and good prompts, so your intelligence grows from project to project.
Every project you build with Spec-Kit Plus produces two things:
Working code (temporary,  can be rewritten anytime)
Reusable intelligence (permanent , your decisions, your reasoning, your best prompts)
It organizes everything using templates, slash commands, and structured folders, so you always save what you learned while working. Over time, this makes you much faster and smarter because each new project benefits from your past learning .
You can also make reusable helpers (skills, subagents, tools) when something works really well.

 # 1. /constitution:
is a command in Spec-Kit Plus that sets the rules and standards for your entire project before you start 
building anything.


# 2./specify
is a command in Spec-Kit Plus that helps you clearly write what you want to build before you start coding.
It creates a clean, detailed description of the feature so there is no confusion later.

# 3./plan
 is a command in Spec-Kit Plus that creates a step-by-step plan for how you will build the feature you described.
It answers questions like:
How will we build it?
What tools or technologies will we use?
What steps come first, next, and last?

# 4. /tasks
is a command in Spec-Kit Plus that breaks your plan into small, clear, to-do steps.
These are tiny pieces of work that are easy to understand and easy to complete.

# 5. /implement
is the command that builds your feature using everything you prepared: the specifications, plan, and tasks. It executes the tasks step by step and produces working code.
